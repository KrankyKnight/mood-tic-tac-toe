# mood-tic-tac-toe

## Description

A fun exercise in too much time with React

## To Run

Run ```npm i``` to install the dependencies

Run ```npm run dev``` to run the app

## Notes

This code snipped was for demo purposes so there isn't a server set up to handle delivery of the production build. To that point, only the dev version is uploaded.
